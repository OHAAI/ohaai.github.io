        <h2 style="margin-left:20px" ;>What is the OHAAI Handbook?</h2>

        <p style="margin-left:20px">OHAAI is a curation of selected papers on Argumentation in AI that will be published as an annual online <strong>Open Access</strong> handbook.​</br>
        </p>
        <h2 style="margin-left:20px" ;>What's the purpose of OHAAI?</h2>
        <p style="margin-left:20px" ;><strong>Argumentation in AI</strong> is seeing an increased interest due to its potential in shedding light onto emerging issues.The purpose of such a handbook is to provide an open access and curated anthology for the argumentation research community. OHAAI will act as a research hub
          to keep track of the latest and upcoming topics and applications of argumentation in AI.
          The handbook mainly aims <strong>to present argumentation research</strong> conducted by current PhD students and early-career researchers in all areas related to AI.
          The handbook’s ulterior goal is <strong>to encourage collaboration and knowledge discovery</strong> between members of the argumentation community.
        </p>
        <h2 style="margin-left:20px" ;>Why and when should I contribute to OHAAI?</h2>
        <p style="margin-left:20px" ;> By contributing to OHAAI, you will have the opportunity to get your work published in a citable <strong>peer-reviewed</strong> venue. This is important if you are just at the beginning of your PhD studies because it will help you start building your research profile from an early stage. If you are still doing your PhD and have already published some of your work or if you have recently submitted your PhD thesis, contributing is good for boosting your research profile even further, because peers will get to know what you have worked on during your PhD. The best part of OHAAI is that it aims to be a continuous project, where you will be able to submit updates to your work in order to keep the research community in touch with your work.</p>

        <h2 style="margin-left:20px" ;>How can I contribute to OHAAI?</h2>
        <p style="margin-left:20px" ;>We seek <strong>short papers</strong> (<em>extended abstracts</em>) that can provide insights into which are the <strong>emerging techniques
            in argumentation for AI</strong> as well as insights and or results into how argumentation in AI can be used for various applications. We encourage work that aims to link AI to other areas relevant to AI using argumentation, inspired from disciplines such as, but not limited to: Philosophy, Psychology, Cognitive Science, Law, Health, Sociology,
          Communication Science, and Economics.​</p>
